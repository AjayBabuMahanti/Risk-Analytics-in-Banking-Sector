🏦 Risk Analytics in Banking and Financial Services

📌 Problem Statement
The aim of this project is to develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and demonstrate how data can be effectively used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

✅ Solution
This Power BI solution provides interactive dashboards using the latest tools in Power BI. The dashboards help financial institutions make data-driven decisions when evaluating loan applications.
Key logic includes:

Approving loans for applicants likely to repay.

Declining or flagging applicants who are at risk of default.

📊 About the Dataset
The dataset contains detailed client and banking-related information. It includes multiple interrelated tables, joined using primary and foreign key relationships.
